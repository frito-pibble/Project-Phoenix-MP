## Phase Details

### Phase 37: Foundation
**Goal**: Fix weight display across all surfaces — per-cable → total weight
**Requirements**: FOUND-01 (#323)
**Recommended Agents**: Senior Developer, Frontend Developer, QA Verification Specialist
**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] All weight displays show total weight (per-cable × 2)
- [ ] Unit preference (kg/lbs) respected
- [ ] Single-cable exercises handled correctly
- [ ] No double-multiplication regressions
- [ ] Insights tab, history, set summary all updated
**Plans**: 2

### Phase 38: Weight-Dependent Features
**Goal**: Implement granular weight adjustments and bulk routine weight changes
**Requirements**: WEIGHT-01 (#266), WEIGHT-02 (#337)
**Recommended Agents**: Senior Developer, UX Architect, QA Verification Specialist
**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Weight wheel supports 0.1lb/0.1kg increments
- [ ] User preference for min increment stored
- [ ] Bulk weight adjust by % or absolute in routine editor
- [ ] Both features respect new weight display layer
**Plans**: 3

### Phase 39: Routine Cluster
**Goal**: Enable superset reorder and routine parent grouping
**Requirements**: ROUTINE-01 (#365), ROUTINE-02 (#307)
**Recommended Agents**: Senior Developer, Frontend Developer, UX Architect
**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Exercises inside supersets can be reordered
- [ ] Supersets can be dragged relative to standalone exercises
- [ ] Parent groups created/edited for daily routines
- [ ] Routines can be moved between groups
- [ ] Drag-and-drop edge cases handled
**Plans**: 3

### Phase 40: Analytics
**Goal**: Add bodyweight volume tracking and historical time estimates
**Requirements**: ANALYTICS-01 (#229), ANALYTICS-02 (#225)
**Recommended Agents**: Senior Developer, Data Analytics Engineer, UX Architect
**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Body weight captured in settings or per-exercise prompt
- [ ] Push-up/pull-up volume calculated per formula
- [ ] Decline height options available
- [ ] Routine time estimates based on historical completion
- [ ] AMRAP handling for time estimates
**Plans**: 3

### Phase 41: Quick Wins
**Goal**: Ship independent UX improvements for immediate user value
**Requirements**: UX-01 (#190), UX-02 (#228), AUDIO-01 (#100)
**Recommended Agents**: Senior Developer, Frontend Developer, QA Verification Specialist
**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Routine auto-starts when first exercise selected
- [ ] Timer pause/restart buttons available on timed exercises
- [ ] Countdown sounds improved (last 10 seconds)

- [ ] Real-time power tracking during set
- [ ] Auto-end set when threshold reached
- [ ] Audio/visual alert at threshold
- [ ] Integration with existing biomechanics engine
**Plans**: 3

### Phase 44: Integration Validation
